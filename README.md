This is a fork used by `ctp`, checkout [its repos](https://github.com/samuelroland/ctp) to use this !

**Changes made to the CLI and core logic**  
To fit my teacher's needs or just making things prettier, I did a few changes to the source code which you can read in details in the recent commits, but here is a quick recap:
1. Remove extra line breaks to avoid having 3 empty lines between elements

todo: remove extra space
todo: const bug
todo: other issue see feedbacks
todo: print message about generation done
todo: free function present in class

**See the original README in [README.rst](README.rst)**
